## 📝 Project Report Details
- **Title:** PID Implementation on a Self-Balancing Bot  
- **Submitted To:** Department of Electronics andaComputer Engineering, Purwanchal Campus, IOE, Tribhuvan University  
- **Submitted By:**  
  - Bishakha Pokhrel (PUR078BEI010)  
  - Rudra Khatri (PUR078BEI031)  
  - Sneha Yadav (PUR078BEI040)  
  - Susant Dahal (PUR078BEI046)  
- **Supervisor:** Er. Manoj Kumar Guragai  
- **Date of Submission:** March 2, 2025  
- **Minor Project Defense:** Successfully defended in front of the evaluation committee.

## 🔧 Hardware Components Used
- **Arduino Nano** – Microcontroller
- **MPU6050** – Gyroscope and Accelerometer Sensor
- **L298N Motor Driver** – Motor control
- **Encoder Motors** – Speed feedback
- **Battery, Jumper Wires, Breadboard**

## 💻 Software Tools Used
- **Arduino IDE** – Programming the Arduino Nano
- **Serial Plotter** – Real-time data visualization

## 📊 Results & Observations
- The bot successfully maintains balance using **PID control** but experiences slight oscillations.
- Encoder feedback improves stability but requires fine-tuning.
- Successfully demonstrated working principles during the **Minor Project Defense**.
- Future improvements: **Better PID tuning, sensor calibration, frame stability**.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository
1. **Download the Report** 📄 - Get insights into the hardware, software, and control logic.
2. **Check the Code (Coming Soon!)** 💻 - Upload the code to an Arduino Nano and experiment with PID tuning.
3. **Explore the Images & Data** 📈 - Visuals to understand system design and implementation.
